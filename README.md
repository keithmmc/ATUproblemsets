problem 1 print hello world 


this is a the first piece of code people learn when starting to code, in order to make this code do a little bit more I added a variable called input that asks for the user name
what is your name 
what is your name keith 
this will then been displayed with hello world 
helloworld  keith

problem 3 account number 

this problem asked the following, .

Write a python program that reads in a 10 character account number and outputs the account number with only the last 4 digits showing (and the first 6 digits replaced with Xs) 
to solve this I started by asking the user to enter a 10 degit number. that created a string from the the input. 
I then created another string and then [-4:] this would splice the first 6 numbers from the account number. to test this I used the following the sequence enter your 10 degit account number: 2345678910
I then used a test print statement to print the last 6 digits. which gave me 8910.
I then printed  6 x's with the string{final} to display the final four digits as xxxxxx8901 

 
 
 Problem Number 4 controlling the flow 
this problem looked at the collatz conjecture, The Collatz conjecture states that all paths will eventually lead to one. 
this programme was designed to ask the user to enter a positive number greater than 1, if one is entered the user will be asked to enter a number greater than one. if a number less than one is entered the user will be asked to enter a positive number to begin the sequence. If the integer is even it is divided by two and if the number is odd it is multiplied by 3 and one is added
I used the number 34 as the first test integer so the sequence the sequence ran as 34 17 52 26 13 40n 20 10 5 16 8 4 2 1. 
I then used the number 9 to test this sequence. the sequence ran as follows 9 28 14 7 22 11 34 17 52 26 13 40 20 10 5 16 8 4 2 1
